# Interactive Connect Four Agent
### Contributors: Dylan Lemon, Hudson Conkling & Owen Mockabee
For our final project for CPSC 3550, we used python to create an interactive 
Connect 4 agent that allows a user to play connect 4 against an agent at a 
selected difficulty level.  We always allow the user to go first rather than 
the agent.

The user can select easy, intermeidate, or expert difficulty.

For the easy difficulty level, the agent with make completely random moves. 
At the intermediate difficulty level, the agent takes a hueristic appraoch to 
playing the game. At the expert difficulty level, the agent makes the best move 
based on the results of monte carlo tree search that solves connect 4, however 
the agent is sitll beatable since it does not play first

### How to use?

Enter the command 'python3 game.py' or use 'make' to start the game. Then, 
follow the prompts given to you on the screen.

First you will input your user name and then select a difficulty level for 
the agent.  Once your difficulty level is selected you will insert column 
numbers to play the game.
